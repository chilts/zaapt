Tutorial
--------

Before you start, you need to be familiar with all of the following:

* Debian
* Apache2
* Mason (therefore Perl too)
* PostgreSQL

(Notice that this list is my variation on LAMP - but instead DAMP!)

Some people may be put off by that list but if you're not, then Zaapt is for
you because Zaapt is a programmer's CMS. Instead of automatically installing a
website and having to click around, you install, control and interface with
Zaapt using your normal everyday editors, command line tools and other things
you already like.

If you are not familiar with the above list but you have a good idea about Linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is a Programmer's CMS?
---------------------------

Firstly, I will answer this question.

A programmer's CMS is for those people who want:

* to be in complete control of the database
* to be in complete control of the webserver
* to be in complete control of the site code
* to allow the Content Management System to edit Content only
* to be compliant with best practices (such as Linux Filesystem Hierarchy and
  other Debian practices)

As a quick example, some CMS's require you to have a writeable directory inside
the Apache DocumentRoot. This doesn't sound like best practise to me. Instead
you create a directory during package install, with the correct permissions and
in the correct place on the file-system (eg. /var/lib/mysite/uploads instead of
/var/www/mysite/uploads) and DirectoryAlias that into the right place in the
webserver.

So already with that small example it means you need to know about Debian file
hierarchy, correct owner and permissions for the webserver and a number of
Apache2 config options.

Suffice to say I won't follow up all of these points now but may touch on them
at various points in this tutorial.

Stages of Development
---------------------

We're going to build a personal website which we're going to call 'mysite.com'
and we'll do it in stages so you can see what's happening at each turn.

Site I

This tutorial is going to start off just getting a website up and going. It
will have a section at the top level (/) which is just plain content managed
pages. We will also put a blog at the second level (/blog/).

You won't yet have logins or the administration interface but you will be able
to add pages via some direct database calls.

Site II

Here we will add a menu to the site so that we can navigate around.

Site III

The next step is to then have an administration interface into which you can
login and edit content.

Site IV

Now that most of the site is working we will delve into a few other content
models. We will add a news section (/news/) and another blog
(/random-thoughts/) just so you can see how to add more content throughout the
site.

Site V

Finally, we will allow other people to register on the site and browse to a
forum so everyone can chat to each other. We will also add the ability for them
to message each other through the site.

Please read TUTORIAL-{1..5} for further details. Note that all code in each of
the tutorials will be available in /usr/share/doc/zaapt/examples/site-{1..5}.
