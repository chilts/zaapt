!1 Design Considerations

Since Zaapt includes the bare minimum HTML, there should be an easy way to
override the built in Mason components with your own - and luckily there is.

Using multiple component roots means you can automatically use Zaapt's model
rendering and widget rendering components, but if you'd like to customise it to
something else, just place a component with the same path and name in your
site's component root and Mason will automatically call it instead of Zaapts.
