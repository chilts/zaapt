<h1>directory section Help</h1>

<p>
    The directory section model helps you manage directory sections and their associated files.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Required</h2>

    Each directory section had three permissions which determine who can change what in
    that particular file.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>admin</dt>
    <dd>

        itself
    </dd>

    <dt>view</dt>
    <dd>
        allows you to see the list of <strong>files</strong> in the admin
        interface
    </dd>

    <dt>edit</dt>
    <dd>
        allows you to add/edit and delete <strong>files</strong> from this
        <strong>directory section</strong>
    </dd>
