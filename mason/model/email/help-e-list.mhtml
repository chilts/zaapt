<h1><a href="edit-e-list.html">Email List</a></h1>

<p>
    &laquo;&laquo; <a href="edit.html">Admin</a>
</p>

<p>
    The email list shows all of the emails that have been added via the admin
    interface. The emails that have been sent out automatically via other
    models are not shown. Generally, these are added and sent automatically,
    therefore editing of them is not required (nor useful).
</p>

<p>
    Each email in this list has the following four actions: (i) <a
    href="help-e.html">add an email</a>, (ii) <a href="help-e.html">edit a
    particular email</a>, (iii) <a href="help-e-send-notification.html">send
    one as a notification</a> or (iv) <a href="help-e-send-to.html">send one to
    a specific list of accounts</a>. You can choose these in the right-hand
    column. Some details about each email are in the left-hand column.
</p>

<p>
    Note: Generally, you do not want to edit an email that has already been
    sent out. Even in the case of wanting to re-send it with some
    modifications, it might be worth copying the information to a new email so
    that you know what emails have been sent to who. But please see <a
    href="help-e-send-to.html">Send To</a> for details when re-sending an email
    can come in useful.
