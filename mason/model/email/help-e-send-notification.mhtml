    When people signed up to this site, they were asked whether they would like
    to receive site notifications. All users that had chosen 'Yes' will receive
    emails sent via this screen.
</p>

<p>
    The emails themselves are added to a queue and are sent via a background
    process. This may take a number of minutes dependent on your configuration.
