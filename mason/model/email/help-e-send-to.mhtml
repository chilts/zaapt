<h1>Send an Email To</h1>

<p>
    You may use this screen to send an email to a specific set of
    accounts. This may come in useful occassionally but generally you want to
    <a href="help-a-sent-notification.html">send the email as a
    notification</a>.
</p>

<p>
    There are however two good uses for this screen. The first is for the site
    administrator to test that email addition and sending is working correctly.
</p>

<p>
    The second use is such that you can test what an email looks like. For
    example, let's say you have added an email and feel happy that it is ready
    to be send as a notification. A good way to test if it looks okay is to
    firstly send it to a test group of accounts. If you receive positive
    feedback from your test group that your email (formatting, links, etc) look
    okay, you can feel happier about sending it to many users as a notification
    (yes, your test group will receive it again, but they probably won't mind).
