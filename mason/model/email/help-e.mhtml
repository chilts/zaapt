<h1>Add/Edit an Email</h1>

<p>
    When adding an email, there are four fields which can be
    completed: Subject, Body (Text), Body (HTML) and Type.
</p>

<p>
    You'll notice that there are 2 fields for <strong>Body</strong>. This is so
    that you have the flexibility to send the email as both text and/or
    HTML. The majority of webmail clients show HTML but there are still many
    people using text only clients (which also work using webmail). By giving
    you both fields you may send either text email, HTML email or both. If both
    are sent, the email client shows the alternative most appropriate for that
    user. This also gives you the ability to customise both views of the same
    information.
</p>

<p>
    Once an email has been added, it may then be chosen from the email list to
    be sent to the relevant accounts.
</p>

<h2>Fields</h2>

<h3>Subject</h3>

<p>
    As is normally the case with email, each one <strong>must</strong> have a
    subject. This may be of any length but it's best to stick to something
    reasonably short, say less than 80 chars.
</p>

<h3>Body (Text)</h3>

<p>
    The textual representation of the email is sent exactly as it appears
    here. It is recommended to have two line breaks between each paragraph. If
    you want links, put these on a line of their own starting at the very left
    column which can help if the links are long.
</p>

<h3>Body (HTML)</h3>

<p>
    The HTML version of the body is generated via the usual Zaapt means. How
    this field is interpreted is dependent on what <strong>Type</strong> is
    selected. The field is read and converted into HTML much like many other
    parts of a Zaapt site e.g. content pages, blog entries, news items,
    therefore you should enter the appropriate markup in this field.
</p>

<h3>Type</h3>

<p>
    This field determines how the <strong>Body (HTML)</strong> field (above) is
    interpreted. Zaapt allows <em>code</em>, <em>html</em> and <em>text</em>
    out of the box but your installation of Zaapt may allow others e.g. wiki
    markup, BBCode. Please ask your web administrator for further details.
