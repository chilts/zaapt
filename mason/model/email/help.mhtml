<h1>Email Help</h1>

</p>

<p>
    The email model for Zaapt allows emails to be sent either immediately or
    from a queue. Usually individual emails will be sent by other models in
    Zaapt automatically and will usually trigger on particular events
    (e.g. someone has subscribed to an action and wants to be told when it
    happens).
</p>

<p>
    This administration interface helps by being able to setup bulk delivery of
    emails to be sent at a later time. Currently, you may choose to <a
    href="help-e-send-notification.html">send an email to everyone who has
    notifications turned on</a> or to a <a
    href="help-e-sent-to.html">particular subset of accounts</a> registered on
    the site.
</p>

<h2>Sending Bulk Emails</h2>

<p>
    This admin section allows you to send bulk emails. The general steps are:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="edit-e.html?_act=add">add an email</a> to be sent</li>
    <li>decide who to sent it to (see <a href="edit-e-list.html">Email List</a>)</li>
    <li>click the 'Add Email to Queue' button</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Once done, the email and it's recipients are added to the database for
    later sending. The background task kicks-in at a later time and sends the
    emails out over the course of a number of minutes (this may be determined
    by each individual Zaapt setup - your web administrator will be able to
    advise you).
</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>
    To adminstrate Emails, you must have the <strong>super</strong>
    permission. If you do not have the <strong>super</strong> permission,
    please ask your site administrator for further details.
</p>

<h2>Admin Screens</h2>

<p>This model has the following admin edit screens:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="help.html">Email Admin</a> (this page)</li>
    <li><a href="help-e.html">Add/Edit an Email</a></li>
    <li><a href="help-e-list.html">Email List</a></li>
    <li><a href="help-e-send-notification.html">Send Notification</a></li>
    <li><a href="help-e-send-to.html">Send To</a></li>
</ul>
