<h1>forum Help</h1>

<p>
    The forum model helps you manage forums and their associated topics.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Required</h2>

<p>
    Each forum had three permissions which determine who can change what in
    that particular topic.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>admin</dt>
    <dd>
        allows you to change the attributes of the <strong>forum</strong>
        itself
    </dd>

    <dt>view</dt>
    <dd>
        allows you to see the list of <strong>topics</strong> in the admin
        interface
    </dd>

    <dt>edit</dt>
    <dd>
        allows you to add/edit and delete <strong>topics</strong> from this
        <strong>forum</strong>
    </dd>

    <dt>moderator</dt>
    <dd>
        allows you to moderate this 'forum'. It is not used in the admin
        interface, but only in the 'user' components on the front-end.
    </dd>
