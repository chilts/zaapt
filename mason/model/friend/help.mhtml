<h1>Friend Help</h1>

<p>
    The 'friend' model helps you manage friends only. In fact, there are no
    editing functions (currently) for friends in the admin interface. This may
    change in the future.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Required</h2>

<p>
    Since there are currently no functions in the admin interface, no
    permissions are required for this model.
</p>

<h2>Entities</h2>

<h3>Friend</h3>

<p>
    A 'friend' has the following attributes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>account_id - the 'account.account' who has added this friend</li>
    <li>to_id - the 'account.account' to signify which friend</li>
</ul>

<p>
    [Describe here what each field does.]
</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>
    [Describe here of all the view/user components and when you might want to
    override them.
</p>
