    Usually, a menu would not be available in the main content of a
    site. Therefore, this is just an example of getting the menu, it's items
    and displaying them.

    There are some widget-*.mhtml files here which give you more examples of
    what you can do, but it is really hard to demonstrate a standard way of
    doing a menu since the HTML and CSS varies considerably between different
    sites.

    Therefore, the best way to do it would be to create your own
    widget-my-menu.mhtml component and have that called with the menu name to
    render.
