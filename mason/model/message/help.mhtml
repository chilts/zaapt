<h1>Message Help</h1>

<p>
    The 'message' model helps you manage messages only. In fact, there are no
    editing functions (currently) for messages in the admin interface. This may
    change in the future.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Required</h2>

<p>
    Since there are currently no functions in the admin interface, no
    permissions are required for this model.
</p>

<h2>Entities</h2>

<h3>Message</h3>

<p>
    A 'message' has the following attributes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>account_id - the 'account.account' who has added this message</li>
    <li>to_id - the 'account.account' to signify which message</li>
    <li>subject - the subject of the message</li>
    <li>message - the message itself</li>
    <li>read - shows whether the receiver has read the message</li>
</ul>

<p>
    [Describe here what each field does.]
</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>
    [Describe here of all the view/user components and when you might want to
    override them.
</p>
