<h1>Session Help</h1>

<p>
    The 'session' model helps you manage sessions only. In fact, there are no
    editing functions (currently) for sessions in the admin interface. This may
    change in the future.
</p>

<h2>Permissions Required</h2>

<p>
    Since there are currently no functions in the admin interface, no
    permissions are required for this model.
</p>

<h2>Entities</h2>

<h3>Session</h3>

<p>
    A 'session' has the following attributes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a_session - the session itself</li>
</ul>

<p>
    [Describe here what each field does.]
</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>
    [Describe here of all the view/user components and when you might want to
    override them.
</p>
